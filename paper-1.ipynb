Assume $k$ countries decide not to control pollution. The cost incurred by each of these $k$ countries is $k$, but the cost of each of the $n - k$ countries that did is $k + 3$.\n",

In any other outcome, an arbitrary country that chose to control pollution could have lowered their own cost by switching to doing nothing.

    "<b>Situation</b>: Assume $n$ players are trying to share a binary channel with maximum capacity 1. Each player is greedy and wants to have as much of the bandwidth as possible, but the following rules apply:\n",
    "- $\\sum_j x_j \\geq 1$\n",
    ": each player's benefit = 0\n",

    "Assume the other players sent some $t = \\sum_{j \\neq i} x_j < 1$ flow -- the equation to optimize player $i$'s benefit is given by $x(1 - t - x)$, which is maximized when $x = \\frac{1 - t}{2}$. Hence, $x_i = \\frac{(1 - \\sum_{j \\neq i} x_j)}{2}$, and by symmetry $x_i = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\forall i$.\n",
